Political scientist with demonstrated experience in academia and NGOs. Skilled in text mining, statistical analysis, data management, and data visualization. Strong professional with a Bachelor's degree in Political Science and International Relations from CIDE and a technical degree in Information Technology from IPN.

I am interested in applying data science to solve specific problems, whether public or business. I am constantly seeking challenges as I love to learn. Also, I know how to handle stress, so I am comfortable working under pressure. I always take care of rigor and attention to detail. Passionate about social sciences and technology, I consider myself a multidisciplinary and interesting profile.
